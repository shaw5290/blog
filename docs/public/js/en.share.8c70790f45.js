In an article titled \\"Current Notes\\" in the February 10, 1885, morning edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: \\"A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains every letter of the alphabet: \'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\'\\"[1] Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over the next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with \\"A\\" rather than \\"The\\".[2] The earliest known use of the phrase in its modern form (starting with \\"The\\") is from the 1888 book Illustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form (starting with \\"The\\") became more common despite the fact that it is slightly longer than the original (starting with \\"A\\").","copy_link":"Copy Link","set_as_public":"Set as public","set_as_private":"Set as private","download":"Download","delete":"Delete","no_map":"No map yet.","open_with_app":"Open With App","upload_by":"Upload by","gallery":"Gallery","on":"on","exit":"Exit"}')}}]);
